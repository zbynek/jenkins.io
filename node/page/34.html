Hudson Anonymous Usage Data
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
In late 2008, the Hudson team released version 1.264 which added an anonymous reporting feature (you can opt-out in the "Manage Hudson" screen). The reporting feature has been sending information back to the Hudson team to help us understand how Hudson is used in aggregate; the info being reported includes the number of jobs configured, slave configurations, what plugins (and what versions of those plugins) are installed, and more. This data has not been available publicly until now! The raw data needed to be decrypted and scrubbed of any potentially identifying information, such as non-public plugin names or usernames in snapshot versions. We've finally scrubbed the data and are <strong>making it available</strong>!<br/>
<br/>
The data is currently in monthly JSON bundles, organized by unique install key. We've filtered out reports of installations without any jobs configured, as well as any installations with only one report in a given month. <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like access to the data, please send an email to dev@hudson.dev.java.net or jump onto the <A href="http://hudson-labs.org/content/chat">IRC channel</a> and ask - we'll send you the URL and a private username/password which you'll need to access the info. We're also planning to do more analysis of the data ourselves, for now feast your eyes on <a href="http://bit.ly/aC6wIo">this spreadsheet</a>, which shows the total number of unique installations seen per month and the number of unique installations of each publicly available plugin per month.<br/>

<a href='/blog/2010/08/11/quiet-period-feature/'>
Quiet Period Feature
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Commits often come in a burst. This seems to happen mainly for two reasons — people sometimes forget to commit some files, and in the tranquility of waiting for your SCM to finish a commit, people sometimes realize the problems in the commit and they quickly make follow-up changes. The conventional wisdom is that the CI server should wait for the burst to finish before attempting a build. This is said to reduce the chance of having broken build, and it is also sometimes useful in reducing the average turn-around time for builds that take longer.</p>

<p>As such, Hudson is capable of waiting for a commit burst to be over before it triggers a new build, and this feature is called "quiet period." There are two parts in Hudson that interacts with the quiet period. One is the SCM polling behavior and the other is the queue.</p>

<p>The queue portion of the quiet period is straight-forward. When a build is scheduled into the queue with quiet period, the build will sit in the queue until the quiet period expires. If during this period, additional attempts are made to put the same build in the queue, the quiet period resets to its initial value. For example, if the quiet period is 5 minutes, and the build is put into the queue 9:00am and 9:03am, the actual build will only happen after 9:08am. Thus another way to think of the quiet period is that you are requiring a certain period of inactivity.</p>

<p>The above applies to all the mechanisms in Hudson that puts builds into the queue. This includes REST API call, CLI call, downstream triggers, and SCM pollings. So if you implement some kind of a "push" mechanism in your SCM to notify Hudson of a new commit, then you get the desired effect by just setting the quiet period in Hudson, and those push scripts don't have to do anything tricky.</p>

<p>It is also possible for some of those to override the quiet period configured in the project. For example, when you click "Build Now" button in your browser, your browser is making a REST API call, but with the quiet period of zero. I used to run a "push" script that looks into a commit message and overrides the quiet period by taking advantages of this feature.</p>

<p>The other portion of the quiet period that often matters is the SCM polling behaviour. Up until Hudson 1.346, the way Hudson defined the SCM abstraction made it impossible for SCMs to correctly report newly detected commits since the last polling. Instead, it was only possible to report if the repository is newer than the workspace. As a result, if the polling interval is set shorter than the quiet period, the build stayed in the quiet period forever. This was tracked in HUDSON-2180.</p>

<p>Hudson 1.346 fixed this issue, and so if you are using a newer version of Hudson and SCM plugins that take advantage of this improvement, then everything works as expected. Otherwise, avoid setting quiet period longer than the polling interval.</p>

Big Security Fix! Hudson 1.371 Released
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
<p>Hot on the heels of Hudson 1.370, which was released last Friday, the Hudson team released 1.371 which addresses a <strong>critical vulnerability</strong> in <strong>all</strong> Hudson versions prior to 1.371. The vulnerability was disclosed by <a href="http://infradna.com">InfraDNA</a> in the <a href="http://infradna.com/content/security-advisory-2010-08-09">following security advisory</a>, which details the issue:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This critical vulnerability allows an attacker to use CLI commands that they are otherwise unauthorized for. CLI commands can perform various administrative operations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is advised that <strong>all</strong> Hudson instances be upgraded immediately to avoid data loss or other ill effects from this issue. If you're upgrading from a version earlier than 1.370, you can consult the <a href="/changelog">changelog</a> for details on the other bug fixes and enhancements covered by the upgrade of your version to 1.371.</p>

<p>If you run a Hudson instance, it is recommended that Hudson system admins subscribe to either the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hudson-security-advisories">security advisories RSS feed</a> or the <a href="advisories-subscribe@hudson.dev.java.net">advisories@ mailing list</a>

Dogfooding Hudson - We're Looking for Slaves!
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
As you may have noticed, thanks to the link on this and the other pages here at <a href="http://hudson-labs.org">hudson-labs.org</a>, the Hudson development community has recently introduced <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org">ci.hudson-labs.org</a>, the official Hudson-on-Hudson instance. We're currently building <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_main_trunk/">Hudson proper</a>, the <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/hudson_rc_branch/">Hudson core RC branch</a>, individual builds for <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Plugins/">the various Hudson plugins</a> and <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/job/gerrit_master/">Gerrit</a>, as well as various <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Libraries/">libraries</a> and <a href="http://ci.hudson-labs.org/view/Infrastructure/">infrastructure jobs</a> Hudson depends on.<br/>
<br/>
We're currently running all those builds on a dedicated Linux slave, generously provided to the Hudson project by <a href="http://digg.com">Digg</a>, my employer. This has been great - except for the day when I'd just added all the individual plugin jobs for the first time, we haven't had real problems with capacity. But we are limited in the environments we can run our tests on as a result of only having a Linux slave. We're currently playing with a temporary Windows slave, but we'd really like to have at least one more permanent Windows slave, and a Mac slave as well, so that we can run Hudson's core integration tests on those platforms as well. Since this is Hudson we're talking about, we don't need the slave to be in any given physical location - we just need it to be running the slave process and talking to our server. If you're interested in helping us out with this, please contact me at andrew dot bayer at gmail dot com. Thanks!<br/>

Hosting your Hudson plugin at Github
</a>
</h1>
<div class='content'>
For as long as Hudson's had a plugin model and development community, we've provided <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hosting+Plugins">source code and binary hosting</a> through our Subversion repo at <a href="http://java.net">java.net</a>. But what if you're a plugin developer and you don't want to use Subversion? Well, we have an alternative for your source code: host it with <a href="http://github.com/hudson">Hudson on GitHub<a>.<br/>
<br/>
<img src="http://www.hudson-labs.org/sites/default/files/octocat.png" align="right" hspace="10" alt="Octocat!" width="180"/><br/>
<br/>
To get this in place, send an email to <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">dev@hudson.dev.java.net</a> (or ask in <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">the IRC channel</a>) asking to get a repository created for your plugin at Github. Make sure to include the name of the plugin and your Github username (and the Github usernames of any other developers who'll be pushing to your plugin's repo). If your plugin is already in Github, include the URL for the existing repo so that we can fork it. One of the Hudson admins will create the repository (forking if appropriate) and add the user(s) to the list of users with push access to the Hudson-hosted repositories at Github. Once you hear back from them, you'll be able to push code to the new repository.<br/>
<br/>
You will need to make a few changes to your plugin's POM, as compared to what works for a plugin POM in the java.net Subversion tree.<br/>
<!--break--><br/>
<strong>First</strong>, add the following to the <code><build><plugins></code> section:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
      <plugin><br/>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId><br/>
        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId><br/>
        <version>2.0</version><br/>
        <dependencies><br/>
          <dependency><br/>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.scm</groupId><br/>
            <artifactId>maven-scm-provider-gitexe</artifactId><br/>
            <version>1.3</version><br/>
          </dependency><br/>
        </dependencies><br/>
      </plugin><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
This is needed to make sure we're overriding the parent POM's SCM provider settings. Next, add the following to the <code><build></code> section:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
    <extensions><br/>
      <extension><br/>
        <groupId>org.jvnet.wagon-svn</groupId><br/>
        <artifactId>wagon-svn</artifactId><br/>
        <version>1.9</version><br/>
      </extension><br/>
    </extensions><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
This is needed because we're still going to be using wagon-svn to deploy the artifacts in the release process. Lastly, add an <code><scm></code> section, within the <code><project></code> section of the POM, like the following:<br/>
<br/>
<code><br/>
  <scm><br/>
    <connection>scm:git:git://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo.git</connection><br/>
    <developerConnection>scm:git:git@github.com:hudson/your-plugin-repo.git</developerConnection><br/>
    <url>http://github.com/hudson/your-plugin-repo</url><br/>
  </scm><br/>
</code><br/>
<br/>
As with the first section, this is needed to override the default SCM settings in the parent POM. Make sure to change "your-plugin-repo" to your actual plugin repository name, of course! It'd also be a good idea to put a link to your Github repo on your plugin's wiki page at <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org">the Hudson wiki</a>, since the default source link will go to Subversion.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with these changes in place, committed and pushed to the master branch in your plugin's repository, you should be able to run "mvn release:prepare release:perform" just as you would if the plugin were hosted in Subversion, with your plugin showing up in the Update Center within a few hours. Be sure that you've configured the login information for the java.net Maven repository, as detailed <a href="https://javanettasks.dev.java.net/nonav/maven/config.html">here</a> - this is still needed for plugins hosted at and released from Github, since Hudson's Maven repository still lives at java.net. If you run into any issues releasing your plugin from Github, first be sure to review the <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Hosting+Plugins">wiki page on plugin hosting</a>, which addresses many of the issues you may encounter when running the Maven release plugin. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're still stumped, feel free to email <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List">the Hudson developer list</a> or ask in <a href="http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/IRC+Channel">the IRC channel</a> for help.<br/>
